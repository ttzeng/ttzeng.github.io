# Design with STM32 Microcontrollers

## Overview

[STM32][1] is the ARM Cortex-M based microcontroller family designed by STMicroelectronics, which currently consists of 15 series in High Performance, Mainstream, Ultra Low Power, and Wireless groups.

## Software Development

**STM32-base** and **STM32Cube IDE** are two prominent development environments for STM32 microcontrollers, each serves different needs and preferences in embedded systems development:

- [STM32Cube IDE][2] is an Eclipse-based IDE provided by STMicroelectronics that serves as a comprehensive software development platform for developing code running on STM32 microcontrollers. It integrates features and various tools, such as [STM32CubeMX][4] - a graphical based configuration and code generator, into a single environment, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced developers.
These tutorials
<sup>[[5],[6],[7],[8]]</sup>
provide references to develop STM32 code using STM32Cube IDE.

- [STM32-base][3], on the other hand, is an open source project for students and hobbyists that provides a foundational framework and templates for developers working with STM32 microcontrollers, to simplify the development process for applications using STM32 microcontrollers.

The conventional way to program an STM32 is to use either an [ST-Link][10] or a SWD (Serial Wire Debug) programmer, it also can be done by using the factory bootloader<sup>[[9]]</sup> through UART, I2C, or USB, etc. For example, the STM32F103C8 MCUs have a built-in serial bootloader that allows for programming the devices via UART. The [STM32CubeProgrammer][11] is a multi-OS tool which provides a comprehensive environment for reading, writing, and verifying device memory through all the above interfaces.
On startup, if the `BOOT0` pin is set to 1, the STM32 will enter the Bootloader mode. For STM32F103C8 MCUs, the default `USART1` is used for the communication through **PA9** (`TX`) and **PA10** (`RX`) pins on 115200 bps.
