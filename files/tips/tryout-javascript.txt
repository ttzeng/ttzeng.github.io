There are several convenient ways to quickly try out JavaScript code without needing to set up a full development environment. Here are some options:

### 1. Browser Console
Most modern browsers come with a built-in JavaScript console. You can access it by right-clicking on a webpage, selecting `Inspect` or `Inspect Element`, and then navigating to the `Console` tab. You can type and run JavaScript code directly there.

### 2. Online Editors
There are many online code editors where you can write and execute JavaScript code instantly. Here are some popular options:

- **JSFiddle**: [jsfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net) - A popular tool for writing and sharing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code snippets.
- **CodePen**: [codepen.io](https://codepen.io) - An online community for testing and showcasing user-created HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code snippets.
- **JSBin**: [jsbin.com](https://jsbin.com) - Another online editor for testing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in real-time.
- **PlayCode**: [playcode.io](https://playcode.io) - A user-friendly environment for running JavaScript code with live output.

### 3. Local HTML File
You can create a simple HTML file on your computer and run it in a browser:

1. Open a text editor (like Notepad, Visual Studio Code, or Sublime Text).
2. Write a basic HTML structure and include JavaScript in a `<script>` tag:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>JavaScript Test</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>JavaScript Test</h1>
       <script>
           console.log("Hello, World!");
           alert("This is a test alert!");
       </script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

3. Save the file with a `.html` extension (e.g., `test.html`).
4. Open the file in your web browser to see the results.

### 4. Node.js
If you have Node.js installed on your machine, you can run JavaScript code directly in your terminal or command prompt:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Type `node` to enter the Node.js REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop).
3. Write your JavaScript code and press Enter to see the output.

### 5. JavaScript Playground Apps
There are also mobile apps available for both Android and iOS that allow you to write and test JavaScript code on the go, such as **Dcoder** and **SoloLearn**.

These methods should help you quickly try out JavaScript code and test your ideas effectively!
